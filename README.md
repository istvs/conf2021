# Welcome

## ISTVS conferences form an amazing legacy since our first meeting in 1962

Today the International Society for Terrain-Vehicle Systems is a connected group of collaborative professionals from industry, universities, and research institutions who have been meeting over five decades to share research findings.

**The 11th Asia-Pacific Regional Conference of the ISTVS** gives you the opportunity to exchange ideas and technical information on current and future research and technology developments in terramechanics and terrain/road-vehicle system dynamics, control, design, vetronics, artificial intelligence, autonomous and unmanned vehicle systems, field and planetary exploration robots, digital-twin, and Industry 4.0.

**The conference will be fully online, September 26-28, 2022 //** You will have the opportunity to participate in keynote talks and conference sessions and conduct academic exchanges with colleagues in the varied fields of terramechanics.

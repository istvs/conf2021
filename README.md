# 20th International and 9th Americas Conference of the ISTVS

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Montreal 2021 not CFP - Social 1280 × 640.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Our international conferences form an amazing legacy since our first meeting in 1962 in Turin, Italy — International Society for Terrain-Vehicle Systems (ISTVS) today is a connected group of collaborative professionals from industry, universities, and research institutions who have been meeting over five decades to share research findings.

The 20th International and 9th Americas Conference gives you the opportunity to exchange ideas and technical information on current and future research and technology developments in terramechanics and terrain/road-vehicle system dynamics, control, design, vetronics, autonomous vehicle systems and Industry 4.0.

The conference will be fully online this year. While we will miss our long-standing tradition of an in-person technical tour, we are looking forward to the new opportunities for strengthening ties between a broader range of colleagues in our very international community than our in-person meetings allowed. The conference platform will give you a chance to participate in live keynote presentations and conference sessions, view self-guided poster sessions, and time for chances to meet on the platform with other attendees. #ISTVS2021
